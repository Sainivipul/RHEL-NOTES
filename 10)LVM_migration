#####MIGREATE LVM from one server to other server##### 
LV1 on DISK1_SERVER1 

#step1- unmount
umount /dir

#step2 deactivate Volgrup 
vgchnage -an VolGrp 

#step3 export VG 

vgexport VG

#step4 poweroff current servwer 
init 0

#step5 switch to another server on which we wannt to import it (use an existing Virtual disk )
and locate that perticular virtual disk 
power on the machine our older disk will be available but only server is change 
physical volumes will be available but no vg will be available 


#step6 import vg and activate it 
vgimport  VG
vgchange -ay VG 

#step7 - now LV automatically got configured like befor 
just mount it on dir on which it was previously mounted 

------------(migrate LV and VG from one Disk to another )------------------

DISK1 (sdb)--> sdb1 --> physicalvol-->volgrp newVG-->logical vol newLV (format FS and mount data)

to migrate it on other disk first we need to make partition on other disk
#step1 paertion on other disk

DISK2 (sdc)--> partition(sdc1)

#step2 Extend the vg 
vgextend NewVg /dev/sdc1         **important

#move physical volume 
pvmove -n NewLV /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1

nowdata NNEWVG and NEW LV is moved on sdc disk which was befor on sdb
but we can see Newvg nad newlv aslo present on sdb1 so can remove it 

# remove vg and lv from sdb 
vgreduce NewVg /dev/sdb1 

------------{##migrate all the LV and Vg to diffrent Disk}-----
check availabe LV and Vf (lsblk )
(vgs -o+devices )

#step1 create partiton and physical vol  on that disk on which data is need to be transfer 
fsidk -l sdd --> sdd1(partition)
pvcreate /dev/sdd1

#step2 extend vgs which need to be migrated with pv on other disk 
vgextend rhel(command volgroup ) /dev/sdd1\

#step3 move LVMs

pvmove -n root /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
pvmove -n swap /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
