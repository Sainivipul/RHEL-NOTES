##NETWORK INTERFACE 
A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network.
A network interface is generally a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form.

##LOOP BACK
In the area of networking and computer systems, understanding the concept of a loopback address is necessary. Often known as the “localhost” or “loopback interface,”
this interaction has a significant impact on how well computers operate.

##BRIDGE NETWORK 
A bridge in a computer network is a device used to connect multiple LANs together with a larger Local Area Network (LAN). The mechanism of network aggregation is known as bridging. 
The bridge is a physical or hardware device but operates at the OSI model’s data link layer and is also known as a layer of two switches

##NAT 
With NAT, all communications sent to external hosts actually contain the external IP address and port information of the NAT device instead of internal host IP addresses or port numbers. 
NAT only translates IP addresses and ports of its internal hosts, hiding the true endpoint of an internal host on a private network.
